# AdvancedPacmanDQNs
GitHub repo containing the agents, analysis scripts, and figures from [Advanced DQNs: Playing Pac-man with Deep Reinforcement Learning](www.cavml.com/research)

##### Instructions
To run agents yourself, you'll need a [keras-rl](https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl) version that includes NoisyNetworks, Prioritized Experience Replay, and N-step TD. For now, that probably means using our [forked version](https://github.com/jakegrigsby/keras-rl). Download it and place keras-rl and AdvancedPacmanDQNs in the same directory.

Dependencies include: keras, keras-rl, numpy, PIL, cv2, matplotlib, gym.
